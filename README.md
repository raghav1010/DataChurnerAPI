# creditcard-churner

This is the initial code which I had written .
The approach followed is a very basic one with resources to interact with the api.
the query filtering done is also naive and every time all records are fetched and records are extracted by using dictionaries and finding subsets in dictionaries.
In the further approach I have tried to build the project around resources and models separately.
